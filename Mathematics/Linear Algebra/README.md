# Linear Algebra

#### Scalars
Scalars are just values that represent something. Just normal values.


#### Vectors

Operations:
-> Addition (Dot Product): Total work achieved through both vectors in quantified form

-> Scalar Multiplication: leads to vector growth or shrinks.

-> Projection: Shadow of a vector placed on other vector, helps in anaylizing features of unknown vectors.

#### Matrics

Composition of numbers, symbols or expressions in rectangular array, used to convert expressions into arrays

Operations:
-> Addition: Simply adding corresponding elements of 2 matrics, both matrics needs to be of same order
-> Mutliplication: multiplying the rows of matrix 1 with the columns of matrix 2,  the rows of matrix 1 need to be equal to column of matrix 2 for it to workZZ
